## Working Process

### Before Starting a Phase

1. Read the relevant section in SPECIFICATION.md
2. Review all tasks for the phase in DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
3. Identify any dependencies or prerequisites

### During Development

1. Follow the specification exactly
2. Complete tasks in order when possible
3. Mark tasks as complete: `- [x] Task description`
4. Stop and clarify if something is ambiguous

### After Completing a Phase

1. Run validation checks
2. Update the Execution Log with date, time, and summary
3. Log any decisions in the AI Decision Log
4. Verify all deliverables exist

---

## Logging Requirements

### Execution Log Format

After completing a phase, add an entry:

```markdown
| Date | Time | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | HH:MM | Brief description of what was accomplished |
```

### AI Decision Log Format

When making a decision not explicitly defined in specs:

```markdown
| Date | Time | Phase/Task | Decision | Rationale |
|------|------|------------|----------|-----------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | HH:MM | [Task ID] | [What was decided] | [Why] |
```

### When to Log Decisions

- Choosing between multiple valid approaches
- Specs are ambiguous or incomplete
- Adding something not explicitly defined
- Making performance or compatibility tradeoffs
- Naming something not named in specs

---

## Validation Checklist

Before considering any phase complete:

- [ ] [Validation check 1]
- [ ] [Validation check 2]
- [ ] [Validation check 3]
- [ ] [Validation check 4]
- [ ] [Validation check 5]
