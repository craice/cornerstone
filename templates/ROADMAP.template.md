# [Project Name] — Development Roadmap

> A phased approach to building [Project Name]

## About This Document

This document serves two purposes:

1. **Backlog** — A structured list of all tasks required to build [Project Name], organized by phases. Use it to plan work and guide AI tools through development.

2. **Checklist & Progress Log** — A living record of what has been completed. As tasks are finished, mark them with `[x]` and document the work in the [Execution Log](#execution-log) section.

### How to Use

- **Planning:** Review phases and tasks before starting work
- **Execution:** Reference specific tasks when working with AI (e.g., "Complete task 2.3")
- **Tracking:** Mark tasks as complete and log summaries in the Execution Log
- **Review:** Check the AI Decision Log for decisions made during development

## Using This Roadmap with AI

When working with AI coding tools, you can reference specific phases or tasks:

**Start a phase:**
```
Execute Phase [N] from DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md following SPECIFICATION.md
```

**Complete specific tasks:**
```
Complete tasks [X.X] through [X.X] from DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
```

**Validate a phase:**
```
Run validation checks for Phase [N]
```

### What to Log

- Choices between multiple valid approaches
- Resolutions of ambiguities in the specification
- Additions not explicitly defined in specs
- Performance or compatibility tradeoffs
- Naming decisions for undefined elements
