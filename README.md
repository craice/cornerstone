# Cornerstone

> From idea to implementation through human-AI collaboration

Cornerstone is a structured process for building projects with AI assistance. It transforms rough ideas into well-defined specifications, actionable roadmaps, and finished products.

## Why Cornerstone?

Building with AI works best when:
- Requirements are clear before development starts
- Work is broken into manageable phases
- Decisions are documented for review
- AI has consistent context throughout the project

Cornerstone provides a framework to achieve all of this.

## The 5 Phases

```
DISCOVERY → SPECIFICATION → ROADMAP → SETUP → EXECUTION
```

1. **Discovery** — Define the idea through AI-assisted Q&A
2. **Specification** — Document everything in SPECIFICATION.md
3. **Roadmap** — Break work into phases in ROADMAP.md
4. **Setup** — Prepare AI context in AI.md
5. **Execution** — Build phase by phase, logging progress

## Quick Start

1. Read `CORNERSTONE.md` for the full process
2. Copy templates from `/templates` to your project
3. Follow the 5 phases
